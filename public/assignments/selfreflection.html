        <p class="title">Persuasive Essay Self Reflection:</p>

                <summary class="question">1. What did you learn about writing a thesis statement throughout this process?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Throughout this process, I learned how thesis statements should be formatted. There were a lot of rules that govern
                    how a thesis statement should look, such as excluding facts and information. Also, thesis statements are supposed to
                    be strong, as they can be thought as a "blueprint" for the rest of the essay. This is why we don't use facts and don't
                    state conventional wisdom. But it would be best to find an equilibrium where the thesis isn't too wordy, yet contains
                    enough information for readers to understand what the essay is talking about. If the thesis statement is too vague, the
                    information in the rest of the essay will not support the thesis that well.

                <summary class="question">2. What did you learn about writing an introductory paragraph throughout this process?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    In the introductory paragraph, I learned that there should be a balance on the amount of information you should put,
                    similar to the thesis statement. If there isn't enough information, the reader may not fully understand what you are
                    trying to say. For example, if you are talking about why the Blue-Legged Tasmanian Hippo is amazing, the reader may be
                    confused what such animal is. At the same time, if you provide too much information, the rest of your essay won't expand
                    on your point, so it's basically useless. Also, because introductions should be short to answer the reader's questions
                    after the hook, that information will become compacted, and the reader may miss some of the information, making it obsolete.

                <summary class="question">3. What did you learn about writing a topic sentence throughout this process?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Topic sentences are like thesis statements for body paragraphs; they are blueprints that guide the paragraph. Everything
                    in a body paragraph should refer to the topic sentence, which means by reading the topic, they know exactly what information 
                    and evidence will be present. Also, a golden rule in essay writing is that you should not use weak words (maybe) and
                    casual/conversational phrases (This will be about...). This holds true for topic sentences. And again, there should not be
                    facts in the topic sentence: else the body paragraph will have to only talk about that fact.

                <summary class="question">4. What did you learn about body paragraphs throughout this process?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Body paragraphs are more than just words that express what the author believes. They also contain examples, evidence, and
                    explanations. These support the information and make it more solid, which helps persuade readers. Supports work best when
                    they are from reliable sources, which is why body paragraphs (and the rest of the essay) should not contain any pronouns.
                    Not only do they appear weak as evidence, but they may not represent the entire audience (as in we, they, you).

                <summary class="question">5. What did you learn about writing a concluding statement throughout this process?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    It is important to conclude your essay well. With a good conclusion, the essay feels whole and complete, and the reader
                    knows that there are no more points to be made. The concluding statement should also bring the reader's attention back
                    to the topic/thesis as a reminder to what the author is trying to convey and the purpose of the whole essay.

                <summary class="question">6. What did you learn about the call to action?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    The call to action is where the essay turns to the reader. This call to action can not only reinforce the topic, but also
                    give readers the ability to do something. This is very powerful, as when one is presented with the chance to act, they are
                    more strongly persuaded to believe in why they should do so. In my essay, I had some difficulty writing the call to action
                    as this is where I have to refer to the reader without using pronouns.

                <summary class="question">7. Reflect upon your essay. What are 3 things you feel like you did well / accomplished with this unit and 1 thing you feel like you struggled with / wish you changed for this unit? Use your peer review forms as guidance for this question.</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Some things I feel like I did well are find sufficient evidence for the essay. In most of my peer reviews forms, I have not
                    been scolded for my evidence, and most of them say that the information helps advance the conversation. Anothing thing I did
                    well was choose the right topic. Yes, you could say that this topic is a classic, but I could find a lot of information and 
                    I rarely struggled to find something to put. Finally, I felt good on the balancing of my essay. There weren't too many or too
                    little facts either. There was a lot of things I wanted to talk about, but I narrowed it down to a few to not bore readers.<br><br>
                    Something that I struggled with was formatting my essay. For a major portion of the term I didn't even have my explanations
                    written. There were also some more minor problems such as incorrect word usage and improper transitions. I struggled with
                    figuring out where to put information and eventually I moved entire paragraphs. In the end, I think I managed to finish okay.
