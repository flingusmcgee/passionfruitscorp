        <p class="title">1 v 1 Debate Reflection:</p>
        <p>
            <details>
                <summary class="question">1. What were 3 important things you learned about persuasive arguments from the debate unit? Why were they important things to learn?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Logical Fallacies</span><br>
                    The use of logical fallacies is avoided in a debate because if they are pointed out, it shows that you don't actually have something good to say and
                    that can be detrimental on how your audience and opponent views you and your topic. Using logical fallacies doesn't inform anyone about anything,
                    which can be problematic if you're trying to produce a good rebuttal.<br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Format and Citation</span><br>
                    Debates follow a specific order to make it easier for the debators, the audience, and the examinators to understand what is going on. It is important
                    to structure your debate around this order. Also, I learned how to find and cite sources, including how to use MLA formatting. I learned to find the
                    best sources by looking at articles from well known websites so the information appears trustworthy, and I also learned that it is a good idea to
                    imagine how your opponent would view your arguments.<br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. During the Debates</span><br>
                    During the debate, you should try to stay calm to listen to what your opponent is saying at all times so you can quickly come up with counter-arguments.
                    Also, I learned how to write arguments that would persuade an audience, such as by asking questions to get the audience questioning my opponent's
                    arguments. This helps get the audience's attention and direct it towards you.

                <summary class="question">2. Did the debate preparation change for you when preparing for the 1 v 1 debate in comparison to the 2 v 2? Why or why not?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    It didn't really change that much, except that I had to do about twice the work. Aside from that, I still shad to research the topic, I still had
                    to find my own sources, and I still had to write everything in my own words. Sometimes, it was even easier because I could control what I wanted to
                    talk about in the debate, but other times it was more difficult because the research was slowed down due to only one person doing that.

                <summary class="question">3. Would you say you were prepared? Why or why not?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    I thought that I was going to be prepared, and I forgot the date of the debate, which is why I slowed down my research later in the process. This
                    proved to be a terrible idea because I still wasn't finished my second argument, and was not yet thinking about the potential counter-arguments and
                    rebuttals. Luckily, I managed to finish on the day of the debate, and I managed to put together a decent debate, but I knew it would have been a
                    lot easier if I yiffed the project.

                <summary class="question">4. How did going through the debate change when in a 1 v 1 situation compared to a 2 v 2?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    The 2 v 2 debate was easier to prepare for, but we didn't perform it that well. In the 1 v 1, I knew had researched everything I added, so during the
                    debate I went into deeper detail. The advantages of doing something by yourself is that you know everything that is going on, but at the cost of
                    having to do everything yourself. If I had prepared less, I would have been at a loss of words, trying to say something and failing. But in a
                    partnership, someone could carry on if you couldn't. Fortunately, I did prepare a bit, just enough that I rarely had nothing that I wanted to say.
                    So mainly, the difference is that you can go into further detail with your debate, but that means you had to prepare more.

                <summary class="question">5. What were you most proud of in this unit (can be from either debates)? Explain.</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    In this unit, I was most proud of my 1 v 1 debate. During the 2 v 2, I didn't really talk that much, and our points were sometimes lacking.
                    But during the 1 v 1, I had do all of the talking and all the research and writing. Everything that I wanted to put was in the debate. When
                    debating with a partner, there was someone that could continue the debate if you didn't know what to say. There was someone that could help
                    you with research and writing. But now, everything was on me, and I was really proud that I still managed to put together something good.

                <summary class="question">6. If you were to do this unit again, what would you change about your debate prep/performance? Why? (can be from either debates)</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    For both debates, I would obviously prepare harder, better, faster, stronger than before. If I added more information, my debate would have been
                    denser. During the opening statement in the 1 v 1 debates, I finished before time was up, and I did not even have a closing statement.
