                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Aside from voices, I helped create the script. I wrote the introduction and everything past the adventure part.

                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    We generated the plot with AI, but it was quite complicated. Because the project asked for a simple plot, I suggested that we shorten the story. I had some control over that because I was writing the script.

                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Although there were a lot of things that we could have improved upon, we had a lot of fun. We tried to incorporate some of this fun into the script, and we also added some silly voice lines. In the end, we finished the project anyway, and I'm not ashamed of it.

                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    A lot could have been improved. First, my French is beyond garbage, and I spent more time trying to pronounce the words than acutally saying them. Second, we were goofing around a bit and sometimes we had to rush things. We took a long time to write the beginning of the script because we were adding unnecessary words. Lastly, we switched roles around too much, which could have caused the time loss. For example, Arav was supposed to do the editing, but we later handed it over to Josh.

                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    If we weren't messing around that much, I think we would have generated more ideas. Some of our ideas were, in our opinion, good, but we didn't think of many of them. Everyone contributed a little to the group, either by getting hands-on and doing stuff or just throwing around ideas that could improve the project.
